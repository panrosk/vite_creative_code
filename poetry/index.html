        There a man that denies death,
        <br />
        Fears it will all his heart,
        <br />
        Anxious in every step.
        <br />
        <br />
        He walks, eats, and breaths sorrow,
        <br />
        As he holds near to his mind,
        <br />
        Every thought that he has for a day from god to borrow.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is this other man who can't die,
        <br />
        Every night he cuts every inch he has,
        <br />
        To see if he can finally rest.

        <br />
        <br />
        Both living in hell.
        <br />
        What a twisted existence we have
